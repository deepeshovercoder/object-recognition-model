# Object Recognition Model using Python and OpenCV

Welcome to the Object Recognition Model repository! 

This project implements an object recognition model using Python and OpenCV, aimed at detecting and identifying objects in images or video streams. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or hobbyist, this repository provides a foundation for understanding and building upon object recognition techniques.

## Features

- **Python-based:** Built entirely in Python, making it accessible and easy to understand for developers of all levels.
- **OpenCV Integration:** Leveraging the powerful computer vision library OpenCV for efficient image processing and feature extraction.
- **Object Detection:** Detects objects within images or video streams, with the ability to label and draw bounding boxes around detected objects.
- **Customizable:** Easily customizable to adapt to different object recognition tasks and environments.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Other Python Libraries
